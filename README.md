# Text Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides pdf file for exam answered questions.
This project provides two key functionalities through Python scripts: 
1. Identifying words in a string longer than a specified number of characters.
2. Checking if a word is a palindrome.

## What Was Done
The project comprises two scripts:
- `checkingIfTheWordLongerThan_Function.py`: It filters out words in a pre-defined string that are longer than 'n' characters.
- `checkPalindromeFunction.py`: (Not displayed in the screenshot) Presumably, it checks whether each word in a provided list is a palindrome.

## Installation
Before running the scripts, ensure that Python and Git are installed on your system. If needed, refer to the official installation guides:
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Running Instructions

To run the scripts in this project, follow these detailed steps:

First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. If you haven't installed Git, you need to install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). Then run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:


  1. git clone https://github.com/khalidkassoum/Myintrview_assignment 
  2. cd Myintrview_assignment
  3. python3 checkingIfTheWordLongerThan_Function.py
  4. python3 checkPalindromeFunction.py
The output will be displayed in the command prompt or terminal window.

#Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with running the scripts, ensure that:

You're in the correct directory where the .py files are located.
You have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.
Python is properly installed and added to your system's PATH.
